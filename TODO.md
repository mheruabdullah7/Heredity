# TODO: Make "Istilah dalam Persilangan" Section More Attractive

## Approved Plan
- Transform each term into a card with an icon (using FontAwesome icons already included).
- Add gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and smoother animations.
- Use a grid layout for better responsiveness.
- Enhance colors with modern palettes (e.g., blues and purples with accents).
- Improve the toggle animation for a more polished feel.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Update HTML structure: Replace the <ol> list with a grid of cards, each containing a button with icon and term.
- [ ] Add icons to each term (e.g., Parental: fa-user, Filial: fa-users, etc.).
- [ ] Update CSS: Add gradient backgrounds, hover effects, grid layout, and improved animations.
- [ ] Test the changes by running the page locally to ensure functionality and visual appeal.
- [ ] Finalize and confirm the updated section looks attractive and maintains usability.
